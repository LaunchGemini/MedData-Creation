    /// <summary>
    /// Class to simplify contours induced by segmentation masks defined on a raster grid.
    /// Such contours can be described by sequences of one-unit-long moves with direction
    /// expressed relative to the preceding move. For illustration, consider the following open
    /// contour:
    /// x0
    /// |
    /// x1
    /// |
    /// x2--x3--x4
    ///          |
    ///          x5
    /// This contour may be defined by 6 vertices x0, x1, etc and 5 edges. Equivalently
    /// the contour may be defined using a starting position (x0) and starting direction
    /// (down the page) and a sequence of moves (in {Forwards, Left, Right}:
    /// FFLFR
    /// The appeal of this representation is invariance to local orientation. This motivates
    /// the contour simplification approach used here, which works by replacing patterns of moves
    /// described by sequences of characters in a string (e.g. LRL) with more complex paths defined
    /// (in a direction-relative way) in the continuous 2D domain.
